# Mastermind-AI
Mastermind AI for CSC 7 Discrete Structures

## Overview
This program implements an automated solver for the classic Mastermind code‑breaking game. The AI attempts to discover a hidden 4‑digit numeric code generated by the computer. After each guess, the AI receives feedback indicating:

• 	rr — number of digits that are correct and in the correct position

• 	rw — number of digits that are correct but in the wrong position

Using this feedback, the AI iteratively refines its guesses until it finds the exact 4‑digit code.

The project demonstrates:

• 	State‑based AI logic

• 	Incremental constraint solving

• 	Use of static variables to preserve AI memory

• 	String manipulation and evaluation

• 	Randomized code generation


## AI Guessing Strategy
The AI uses a multi‑phase approach, implemented inside the  function:


#### Phase 1 — Identify which digits appear in the code

The AI cycles through guesses like , , , etc., counting how many correct digits appear.

It stores discovered digits in the  array.


#### Phase 2 — Determine the correct position of each digit

Once all four digits are known, the AI begins placing them one at a time:

• 	It tests each digit in each position.

• 	It uses feedback (, ) to confirm or reject positions.

• 	It progresses through  to place digits sequentially.


#### Phase 3 — Final assembly

After the first three digits are placed, the last remaining digit is placed automatically in the final open position.


##### The AI stores:

• 	All previous guesses

• 	All previous feedback

• 	The digits discovered so far

• 	The positions already confirmed

This allows it to refine guesses logically rather than randomly.
